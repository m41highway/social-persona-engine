Today, the city’s cuisine is an eclectic mix of the traditions these European immigrants brought with them: Italian-style ice cream, empanadas from Spain, wine from vineyards planted by the French, and German-style sausages and cheeses. Beyond Argentina’s capital, generations of gauchos tend cattle on the pastures of the Pampas grasslands. The residents of Buenos Aires, known as <i>porteños</i> (people of the port), are certainly a carnivorous lot. The meat is grilled over an open flame on a <i>parrilla</i>, a heavy duty barbecue found in steak restaurants and in private homes, where families and friends gather for <i>asados</i> (barbecues).</p><div class="halfway-links--related media">

They have some incredible produce to work with: fresh fish and seafood such as crayfish, kingklip and the meaty snoek; cuts of game including springbok that are seasoned and tossed on African-style <i>braais</i> (barbecues) or dried into deliciously moreish biltong; and a cornucopia of fruit and vegetables ripened in the warm southern sun. Innovative cooks also tap into the foraging ways of the indigenous Khoe-San people to incorporate into their menus ingredients such as the leaves and flowers of <i>fynbos</i>, the unique range of plants that flourish in the Western Cape.</p><p class="stack__article__image-container"><a href="/travel-blog/tip-article/wordpress_uploads/2016/10/Food-EDIT-668d7f15b44e.jpg" class="copy--body__link"></a><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/travel-tips-and-articles/a-flavour-of-the-worlds-tastiest-destinations&amp;media=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/travel-blog/tip-article/wordpress_uploads/2016/10/Food-EDIT-668d7f15b44e.jpg&amp;description=SAIGON,%20VIETNAM%20-%202006/08/14:%20Pho%20-%20Vietnamese%20noodle%20soup%20originally%20from%20Hanoi..%20(Photo%20by%20John%20S%20Lander/LightRocket%20via%20Getty%20Images)" class="social__item social__item--pinterest social__item--pinned" target="blank">  <span class="accessibility">Pin this image</span>  <span class="social__icon icon--pinterest icon--white"></span></a><img class="wp-image-109867 size-full stack__article__image is-landscape" src="//images-resrc.staticlp.com/S=W748/O=75/http://www.lonelyplanet.com/travel-blog/tip-article/wordpress_uploads/2016/10/Food-EDIT-668d7f15b44e.jpg" alt="SAIGON, VIETNAM - 2006/08/14: Pho - Vietnamese noodle soup originally from Hanoi..

Shaped by centuries of foreign domination, and often overlooked in favour of bigger, brasher Ho Chi Minh City, this compact, elegant capital is the birthplace of some signature national dishes that have become synonymous with Vietnamese food worldwide, such as <i>pho</i> and <i>bun cha</i>. From the conquering Mongols came beef; Chinese domination contributed cooking techniques such as stir-frying; the French brought baguettes, dill, coffee and wine. Chillies, flat noodles, and coconut milk crossed over from Cambodia, Laos and Thailand. Yet this melange of influences, notable for the abundant presence of fresh herbs, merged into a cuisine uniquely its own. At its heart, Hanoi is a city of gourmands and there’s no better place in Vietnam for street food.</p><p class="stack__article__image-container"><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/travel-tips-and-articles/a-flavour-of-the-worlds-tastiest-destinations&amp;media=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/travel-blog/tip-article/wordpress_uploads/2016/09/GettyImages-499564651_medium-18bc68c04558.jpg&amp;description=Picturesque%20plates%20of%20food%20like%20this%20have%20turned%20Aarhus%20into%20a%20multi-Michelin%20star-winning%20destination%20%C2%A9%C2%A0logoHY%20/%20Getty%20Images" class="social__item social__item--pinterest social__item--pinned" target="blank">  <span class="accessibility">Pin this image</span>  <span class="social__icon icon--pinterest icon--white"></span></a><img class="wp-image-105864 size-full stack__article__image is-landscape" src="//images-resrc.staticlp.com/S=W748/O=75/http://www.lonelyplanet.com/travel-blog/tip-article/wordpress_uploads/2016/09/GettyImages-499564651_medium-18bc68c04558.jpg" alt="Picturesque plates of food like this have turned Aarhus into a multi-Michelin star-winning destination ©&nbsp;logoHY / Getty Images"> Picturesque plates of food like this have turned Aarhus into a multi-Michelin star-winning destination ©&nbsp;logoHY / Getty Images</p><h3 class="copy--h3">Aarhus, Denmark</h3><p>Long labouring in Copenhagen’s shadow, Viking-founded <a href="https://www.lonelyplanet.com/denmark/aarhus" class="copy--body__link">Aarhus</a> on the Jutland peninsula is emerging as a European destination for hyper-local dining with flair.

There is a strong focus on invention in the kitchen, supported by excellent local produce. Aarhus’ surrounds – the bay, the forests and the fields – provide a rich larder of ingredients, from excellent pork, beef, game, dairy and seafood to root vegetables, wild berries and herbs.

Nowhere is this mixed heritage more obvious than in the ancient recipes, ubiquitous spices and common ingredients of this corner of the world.

The foundation stone of South Indian cooking is the tamarind and lentil dipping sauce known as <i>sambar</i>, which is used to dunk everything from crispy <i>dosas</i> (rice flour pancakes) to <i>vada</i> (lentil-flour doughnuts), but chefs are ceaselessly inventive when it comes to finding ways to transform vegetarian staples into gastronomic sensations. Even hardened carnivores will be convinced after just a few mouthfuls.

Every self-respecting coastal town from Kittery north to Calais has a scruffy lobster shack not far from the local dock – they’re great places to slurp thick seafood chowders.
