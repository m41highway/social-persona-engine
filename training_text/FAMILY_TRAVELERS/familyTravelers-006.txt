They are where some of your most vivid family memories are formed, albeit sometimes for the wrong reasons. Ultimately, the destination is unimportant – so much so that the annual holidays blend into one. This is especially true if you go to the same place every year.</p><p class="stack__article__image-container"><a href="/travel-blog/tip-article/wordpress_uploads/2016/04/GettyImages-601799567_super.jpg" class="copy--body__link"></a><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/travel-tips-and-articles/ch-ch-ch-changes-how-the-travel-experience-evolves-with-you&amp;media=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/travel-blog/tip-article/wordpress_uploads/2016/04/GettyImages-601799567_super.jpg&amp;description=Friends%20laying%20on%20paddle%20boards%20in%20ocean" class="social__item social__item--pinterest social__item--pinned" target="blank">  <span class="accessibility">Pin this image</span>  <span class="social__icon icon--pinterest icon--white"></span></a><img class="wp-image-101890 size-full stack__article__image is-landscape" src="//images-resrc.staticlp.com/S=W748/O=75/http://www.lonelyplanet.com/travel-blog/tip-article/wordpress_uploads/2016/04/GettyImages-601799567_super.jpg" alt="Friends laying on paddle boards in ocean"> At last: not a parent in sight © Colin Anderson / Getty Images</p><h3 class="copy--h3">Teenage kicks</h3><p>An unhealthy cocktail of exams and hormones can only mean one thing: letting loose. Ideally, the mayhem takes place as far away from the parentals as possible; a desire to just ‘get away’ – without them – becomes a need, and inevitably this ignites a passion for travel.&nbsp;Funnily enough, your 10 best mates have had the same idea.
