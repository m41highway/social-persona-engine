Yes and, somewhat surprisingly, very much so.</p><p>It feels suitably off-the-beaten-track, but with a range of comfortable digs along the way, cyclists can recharge before tackling <a href="https://www.lonelyplanet.com/ecuador" class="copy--body__link">Ecuador</a>’s tremendous inclines.

A slim band squeezed between the expanse of the Pacific Coast and the vast sprawl of the Amazon, it abounds with microclimates, determined more by geography and altitude than by any season. Within these folds, one steep-sided valley dovetails into the next. Cradled between two volcanic ranges, they form the Avenue of the Volcanoes, as coined by Alexander von Humboldt, the Prussian naturalist who journeyed through the continent in the 19th century.</p><p class="stack__article__image-container"><a href="/travel-blog/tip-article/wordpress_uploads/2016/07/141226_isinlivi_19_1-2-d45493f59121.jpg" class="copy--body__link"></a><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/travel-tips-and-articles/epic-ride-family-bikepacking-in-ecuador&amp;media=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/travel-blog/tip-article/wordpress_uploads/2016/07/141226_isinlivi_19_1-2-d45493f59121.jpg&amp;description=The%20undulating%20hills%20of%20Ecuador" s="" class="social__item social__item--pinterest social__item--pinned" target="blank">  <span class="accessibility">Pin this image</span>  <span class="social__icon icon--pinterest icon--white"></span></a><img class="wp-image-104726 size-full stack__article__image is-portrait" src="//images-resrc.staticlp.com/S=W748/O=75/http://www.lonelyplanet.com/travel-blog/tip-article/wordpress_uploads/2016/07/141226_isinlivi_19_1-2-d45493f59121.jpg" alt="The undulating hills of Ecuador's countryside present a challenge © Cass Gilbert"> The undulating hills of Ecuador's countryside present a challenge © Cass Gilbert</p><p>We shared our Ecuadorian adventures with three brothers I’d first met while cycling through the country three years prior. Mountain guides by trade, they lived off-grid on an organic family farm outside <a href="https://www.lonelyplanet.com/ecuador/quito" class="copy--body__link">Quito</a>. In the interim, we’d kept in touch – and we’d all had children. When the chance came to visit Ecuador once again, this time I travelled with my partner and our two-year-old son Sage, so we might experience this beautiful and unfeasibly rugged country together.</p><div class="halfway-links--related media">

When our three toddlers needed a break, we stopped and played football, helped them climb trees, or just explored the land. And what a land it was. A fertile patchwork of vertiginous fields clung to steep-sided slopes, surrounded by both soaring peaks and crumbling canyon cliffs. Pigs scuffled around by the road, men sauntered by with machetes on their hips, and women crammed their colourful shawls with fresh corn, their felt hats peeking out through the foliage.</p><p>The route itself looped south-east through Ecuador’s Central Sierras. After stopping to applaud the natural watery wonder of Quilotoa, and scout briefly along the knife edge of its crater, it took us through the small settlement of <a href="http://www.lonelyplanet.com/ecuador/chugchilan/introduction" class="copy--body__link">Chugchilán</a>, where we detoured into the dewy delights of the Illiniza Cloud Forest. There, fingers of mist curled through the trees, enveloping the land, filling every nook and cranny with silence. When the sun occasionally permeated through, it was subtle and shadowless, painting the mountains in gigantic, camouflaged swatches.</p><p class="stack__article__image-container"><a href="/travel-blog/tip-article/wordpress_uploads/2016/07/141227_to_toacaso_30_1-2-593e4a6a0fdb.jpg" class="copy--body__link"></a><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/travel-tips-and-articles/epic-ride-family-bikepacking-in-ecuador&amp;media=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/travel-blog/tip-article/wordpress_uploads/2016/07/141227_to_toacaso_30_1-2-593e4a6a0fdb.jpg&amp;description=Handling%20descents%20with%20a%20trailer%20in%20tow%20is%20a%20skill%20you%20acquire%20on%20the%20road%20%C2%A9%20Cass%20Gilbert" class="social__item social__item--pinterest social__item--pinned" target="blank">  <span class="accessibility">Pin this image</span>  <span class="social__icon icon--pinterest icon--white"></span></a><img class="wp-image-104729 size-full stack__article__image is-landscape" src="//images-resrc.staticlp.com/S=W748/O=75/http://www.lonelyplanet.com/travel-blog/tip-article/wordpress_uploads/2016/07/141227_to_toacaso_30_1-2-593e4a6a0fdb.jpg" alt="Handling descents with a trailer in tow is a skill you acquire on the road © Cass Gilbert"> Handling descents with a trailer is a skill you acquire on the road © Cass Gilbert</p><p>Up and down we rode, rarely a flat moment for respite. Climbs had our derailleurs clattering frantically through the gears, spinning our legs in the lowest cadences we could find, the ballast of our toddler cargo weighing us down. In immediate riposte, descents demanded we pull on brake levers like reins on a horse, lest our trailers shunt us forwards. Added to this, the terrain was often bumpy, sometimes even cobbled. Yet when I looked back to check on Sage, more often than not he was sound asleep, oblivious to our efforts.</p><p class="stack__article__image-container"><a href="/travel-blog/tip-article/wordpress_uploads/2016/07/141226_isinlivi_72_1-2-5616458b0f77.jpg" class="copy--body__link"></a><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/travel-tips-and-articles/epic-ride-family-bikepacking-in-ecuador&amp;media=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/travel-blog/tip-article/wordpress_uploads/2016/07/141226_isinlivi_72_1-2-5616458b0f77.jpg&amp;description=An%20Ecuadorian%20cowboy%20heads%20into%20town%20%C2%A9%20Cass%20Gilbert" class="social__item social__item--pinterest social__item--pinned" target="blank">  <span class="accessibility">Pin this image</span>  <span class="social__icon icon--pinterest icon--white"></span></a><img class="wp-image-104730 size-full stack__article__image is-landscape" src="//images-resrc.staticlp.com/S=W748/O=75/http://www.lonelyplanet.com/travel-blog/tip-article/wordpress_uploads/2016/07/141226_isinlivi_72_1-2-5616458b0f77.jpg" alt="An Ecuadorian cowboy heads into town © Cass Gilbert"> An Ecuadorian cowboy heads into town © Cass Gilbert</p><p>Travelling over the winter holidays, we celebrated Christmas in <a href="http://www.lonelyplanet.com/ecuador/isinlivi/introduction" class="copy--body__link">Isinliví</a>, a picturesque settlement perched in one of the region’s verdant valleys. As we came to appreciate, South Americans know how to party, whatever time of the year. The main square was awash with revellers, countryside cowboys and a roving brass band that relentlessly circled its stony streets. To Sage’s delight, it even boasted an antiquated funfair, featuring a merry-go-round that spun with dizzying speed.</p><p class="stack__article__image-container"><a href="/travel-blog/tip-article/wordpress_uploads/2016/07/150221_otovalo_15_1-2-b13592855cd9.jpg" class="copy--body__link"></a><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/travel-tips-and-articles/epic-ride-family-bikepacking-in-ecuador&amp;media=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/travel-blog/tip-article/wordpress_uploads/2016/07/150221_otovalo_15_1-2-b13592855cd9.jpg&amp;description=Keep%20spirits%20and%20sugar%20levels%20up%20with%20regular%20stops%20at%20street%20markets%20%C2%A9%20Cass%20Gilbert" class="social__item social__item--pinterest social__item--pinned" target="blank">  <span class="accessibility">Pin this image</span>  <span class="social__icon icon--pinterest icon--white"></span></a><img class="wp-image-104731 size-full stack__article__image is-landscape" src="//images-resrc.staticlp.com/S=W748/O=75/http://www.lonelyplanet.com/travel-blog/tip-article/wordpress_uploads/2016/07/150221_otovalo_15_1-2-b13592855cd9.jpg" alt="Keep spirits and sugar levels up with regular stops at street markets © Cass Gilbert"> Keep spirits and sugar levels up with regular stops at street markets © Cass Gilbert</p><p>Isinliví was also our last staging post before we tackled the longest climb of the trip, a Herculean undertaking that involved 1000m in altitude gain, on an unpaved road at that.

But I couldn’t more highly recommend trying one out, wherever it may be in the world, for however many days you may have. Gather the troops and brew up a plan. Choose a route that everyone will enjoy. Take the time to luxuriate in being off the bike as much as you are on it. I can guarantee that such undiluted family time will warm the heart and feed the soul. For everyone involved.</p></div>
