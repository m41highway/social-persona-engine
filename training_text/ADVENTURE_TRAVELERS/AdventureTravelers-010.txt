One night, I camped among rocks off the Pamir Highway, grimly wondering if I’d see another sunrise.

My antibiotics were useless; I was tired, defeated, dehydrated and miles from anywhere but eventually I carried on, scaling passes over 4100m.</p><p>Overcoming an intestinal infection is tough.

It's amazing how far you can go without meeting a hill. But then there's the Alps. We took the Via Claudia Augusta, the lowest crossing of the Alps, to head into Italy and on to Venice.</p><p>The mix of river trail and Alpine scenery kept us entertained, with no shortage of riverside swim stops, ice cream breaks and impromptu camping. Highlights include swimming above a sunken village in Italy, the tinkling of cowbells on the Austrian Alpine plateaux, the lively sparkle of the Venetian lagoon in the distance and the celebratory Prosecco at the end.</p><p class="stack__article__image-container"><a href="/travel-blog/tip-article/wordpress_uploads/2016/08/29329777546_ccf0db88b9_k-434e0818b030.jpg" class="copy--body__link"></a><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/travel-tips-and-articles/bikepacker-tales-how-to-see-the-world-from-a-saddle&amp;media=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/travel-blog/tip-article/wordpress_uploads/2016/08/29329777546_ccf0db88b9_k-434e0818b030.jpg&amp;description=The%20chosen%20route:%20Via%20Claudia%20Augusta%20%C2%A9%20Family%20Adventure%20Project" class="social__item social__item--pinterest social__item--pinned" target="blank">  <span class="accessibility">Pin this image</span>  <span class="social__icon icon--pinterest icon--white"></span></a><img class="wp-image-105911 size-full stack__article__image is-landscape" src="//images-resrc.staticlp.com/S=W748/O=75/http://www.lonelyplanet.com/travel-blog/tip-article/wordpress_uploads/2016/08/29329777546_ccf0db88b9_k-434e0818b030.jpg" alt="The chosen route: Via Claudia Augusta © Family Adventure Project"> The chosen route: Via Claudia Augusta © Family Adventure Project</p><h4 class="copy--h4">What was your biggest challenge on the road?</h4><p>There were many.

Ask around but develop your own sense of what's possible. Make an ambitious plan with tactical escape routes. Two weeks in, send home all the stuff you haven't used, except emergency medical or repair items. Don't be afraid to carry a carton of wine for solace or celebration.</p><h4 class="copy--h4">Define ‘epic ride’</h4><p>An epic ride is full of surprises, variety and uncertainty.

In 2013 we decided to go on a long-distance tour and rode through the Americas. We were living our dream, enjoying ultimate freedom, meeting friendly faces and seeing unforgettable landscapes. In two years we rode 32,000km and during this adventure we fell in love with <a href="https://www.lonelyplanet.com/peru" class="copy--body__link">Peru</a>.</p><p>We cycled Peru’s Great Divide – a mountainous off-road track at 4000-5000m above sea level – from Cuzco to Huaraz. We camped under a million stars and had first-class views over Peru’s highest mountain Huascaran (6768m) while the sun set and the sky turned red. The landscape is rough and few people live in this area; only a few abandoned mines and adobe farmhouses, plus grazing llamas, indicate their presence.</p><p class="stack__article__image-container"><a href="/travel-blog/tip-article/wordpress_uploads/2016/09/PERU_20141007_1849-1-d8e043b273da.jpg" class="copy--body__link"></a><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/travel-tips-and-articles/bikepacker-tales-how-to-see-the-world-from-a-saddle&amp;media=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/travel-blog/tip-article/wordpress_uploads/2016/09/PERU_20141007_1849-1-d8e043b273da.jpg&amp;description=peru_20141007_1849-1" class="social__item social__item--pinterest social__item--pinned" target="blank">  <span class="accessibility">Pin this image</span>  <span class="social__icon icon--pinterest icon--white"></span></a><img class="wp-image-106118 size-full stack__article__image is-landscape" src="//images-resrc.staticlp.com/S=W748/O=75/http://www.lonelyplanet.com/travel-blog/tip-article/wordpress_uploads/2016/09/PERU_20141007_1849-1-d8e043b273da.jpg" alt="peru_20141007_1849-1"> Who needs paved roads?&nbsp;© Ellen Van Drunen</p><h4 class="copy--h4">What was your biggest challenge on the road?</h4><p>The track and the altitude. We’d been riding above 4000m most of the time, touching the highest pass at 5000m. And we did this by pushing our bikes through mud, riding very rocky trails and even single tracks.<br>Distances between civilised pit stops are long, especially in this mountainous terrain, so we had to carry a lot of food and our bikes were heavy. The weather wasn’t our best friend either, with daily rain and hail storms in the afternoon.

Remember: the toughest moments make for the best memories!</p><h4 class="copy--h4">Define ‘epic ride’</h4><p>An epic ride hurts. It pushes your limits.
