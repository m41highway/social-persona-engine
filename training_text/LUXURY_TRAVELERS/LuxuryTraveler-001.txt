</div><p class="copy--feature"><span class="feature">Budapest sits on a patchwork of almost 125 thermal springs, and ‘taking the waters’ has been a part of everyday life here since people walked in togas.

Many baths now open at night during&nbsp;the weekend. Fewer and fewer baths have male- and female-only days, so pack a bathing suit or be prepared to rent one.</p><p>Admission charges start at 2400Ft, which in theory allows you to stay for two hours on weekdays and one hour and a half&nbsp;at weekends (a rule seldom enforced nowadays).</p><div class="halfway-links--related media">

Some have outdoor pools with fountains, sprays and whirlpools. Being thermal, some are open year-round.</p><p>Depending on the time and the day of the week, baths can be for men or women only. However, there are usually mixed days and some baths – the Széchenyi Baths in City Park, for example –&nbsp;are always open for men and women together. On single-sex days or in same-sex sections, men are usually handed drawstring loincloths and women apron-like garments to wear, though the use of bathing suits is on the increase even on single-sex days. You must wear a bathing suit on mixed-sex days; these are available for hire (1200Ft) if you don’t have your own. Some pools require even men to use a bathing cap; bring your own or wear the disposable plastic one provided or sold for about 200Ft. Most pools also rent towels (1000Ft), though you are provided with a less-than-absorbent ‘sheet’ as you enter the rest area.</p><p>Most of the baths offer a full range of serious medical treatments plus more indulgent services such as massage (3800/5000Ft per 20/30 minutes), pedicure (3500Ft) and the intriguing red-wine bath (8900Ft). Specify what you want when buying your ticket.</p><p class="stack__article__image-container"><a href="/travel-blog/tip-article/wordpress_uploads/2015/04/Rudas-baths-Budapest_cs.jpg" class="copy--body__link"></a><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/travel-tips-and-articles/a-guide-to-budapests-thermal-baths&amp;media=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/travel-blog/tip-article/wordpress_uploads/2015/04/Rudas-baths-Budapest_cs.jpg&amp;description=Pool%20in%2016th-century%20Rudas%20Baths.%20Image%20by%20De%20Agostini%20/%20C%20Sappa%20/%20Getty%20Images" class="social__item social__item--pinterest social__item--pinned" target="blank">  <span class="accessibility">Pin this image</span>  <span class="social__icon icon--pinterest icon--white"></span></a><img class="size-full wp-image-87295 stack__article__image is-landscape" src="//images-resrc.staticlp.com/S=W748/O=75/http://www.lonelyplanet.com/travel-blog/tip-article/wordpress_uploads/2015/04/Rudas-baths-Budapest_cs.jpg" alt="Pool in 16th-century Rudas Baths.

All baths and pools have cabins and/or lockers. In most of the baths nowadays you are given an electronic bracelet which directs you to and then opens the locker or cabin door. Some places – the Gellért Baths, for example – still use the old, more personal method. Find a free locker or cabin yourself (it’s visual flight rules here). After getting changed in (or beside) it, seek out an attendant (usually wearing a white coat or smock and holding a large bunch of keys), who will lock it for you and hand you a numbered tag to tie on your costume or ‘apron’. Commit your locker number to memory; in order to prevent theft should you lose or misplace the tag, the number on it is not the same as the one for the locker.</p><p class="stack__article__image-container"><a href="/travel-blog/tip-article/wordpress_uploads/2015/04/Lukacs-Baths-Budapest_cs.jpg" class="copy--body__link"></a><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/travel-tips-and-articles/a-guide-to-budapests-thermal-baths&amp;media=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/travel-blog/tip-article/wordpress_uploads/2015/04/Lukacs-Baths-Budapest_cs.jpg&amp;description=Curative%20waters%20of%20Luk%C3%A1cs%20Baths.%20Image%20by%20Gil%20Giuglio%20/%20Getty%20Images" class="social__item social__item--pinterest social__item--pinned" target="blank">  <span class="accessibility">Pin this image</span>  <span class="social__icon icon--pinterest icon--white"></span></a><img class="size-full wp-image-87294 stack__article__image is-landscape" src="//images-resrc.staticlp.com/S=W748/O=75/http://www.lonelyplanet.com/travel-blog/tip-article/wordpress_uploads/2015/04/Lukacs-Baths-Budapest_cs.jpg" alt="Curative waters of Lukács Baths.
