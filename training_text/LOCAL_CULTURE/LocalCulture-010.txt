</div><p class="copy--feature">According to our destination experts, travelling in June is all about celebrating natural wonders, elusive wildlife and creative genius.</p><p>The options are tempting: spot silverback gorillas in the sun-dappled mountain forests of Rwanda, cruise past pink-tinged icebergs at midnight in Greenland, or be part of an art installation on the Italian lakes – throw in a festival or two and June is shaping up to be an exciting month for potential adventurers.</p><p class="stack__article__image-container"><a href="/travel-blog/tip-article/wordpress_uploads/2016/03/GettyImages-158351156_full_1.jpg" class="copy--body__link"></a><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/travel-tips-and-articles/best-places-to-travel-in-june-2016&amp;media=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/travel-blog/tip-article/wordpress_uploads/2016/03/GettyImages-158351156_full_1.jpg&amp;description=Mountain%20Gorilla%20in%20the%20Virunga%20Mountains,%20Rwanda" class="social__item social__item--pinterest social__item--pinned" target="blank">  <span class="accessibility">Pin this image</span>  <span class="social__icon icon--pinterest icon--white"></span></a><img class="wp-image-100513 size-full stack__article__image is-landscape" src="//images-resrc.staticlp.com/S=W748/O=75/http://www.lonelyplanet.com/travel-blog/tip-article/wordpress_uploads/2016/03/GettyImages-158351156_full_1.jpg" alt="Mountain Gorilla in the Virunga Mountains, Rwanda"> Make the most of the June sunshine to photograph gorillas in Rwanda © Piper Mackay / Getty Images</p><h3 class="copy--h3"><b>Track gorillas in Volcanoes National Park, Rwanda</b></h3><p>Gorillas in the mist may be beautifully enigmatic, but nothing beats a ray of sunshine cutting through the depths of the dark African rainforest to light up a silverback and the enchanting members of his family. And given the gorillas’ habitat in <a href="https://www.lonelyplanet.com/rwanda" class="copy--body__link">Rwanda</a> is on the steep-sided slopes of tropical volcanoes, the long climbs to reach them can be an incredibly muddy (read exhausting and frustrating) experience during the wet season.</p><p>That’s what makes June so special – <a href="https://www.lonelyplanet.com/rwanda/northwestern-rwanda/parc-national-des-volcans" class="copy--body__link">Volcanoes National Park</a> receives a mere tenth of the wet stuff that falls in March and April, and this not only provides you with sure footing but also the best chance of great light for photography. Tropical downpours can still happen, but they are brief and the light before and after tends to be rewardingly moody.</p><div class="halfway-links--related media">

Fishing boats stay out late and children roam the streets outside. The activity culminates with the National Day festival on 21 June, the longest day of the year.</p><p>Towns and settlements across the country celebrate with music, folk dancing, flag hoisting and speeches. Museums also mark the day with special events and exhibitions, making June the perfect time to visit.</p><p><i>Kia Abdullah – Editor at </i><a href="http://atlasandboots.com/" target="_blank" class="copy--body__link"><i>atlasandboots.com</i></a><i> and LP Pathfinder.
