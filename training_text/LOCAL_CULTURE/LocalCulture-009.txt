For many days before 20 March, the women of each household clean and cook and prepare for the&nbsp;new year. S<em>umalak</em>&nbsp;(Sümölök; Сумолок in Kyrgyz), a wheat-based beverage, shows up on the streets this one day each year. The wheat is soaked in water&nbsp;for a week until it sprouts, and it has to be cooked for a full day with sugar, flour and oil. Dark, grainy, earthy, thick…it's the kind of thing you want to drink exactly once a year.</p><p>A Nowruz dinner table is traditionally laid out with seven items, all beginning with the Arabic sound ‘sh’ – <em>sharob</em> (wine), <em>shir</em> (milk), <em>shirinliklar</em> (sweets), <em>shakar</em> (sugar), <em>sharbat</em> (sherbet), <em>sham</em> (a candle) and <em>shona</em> (a new bud). The candles are a throwback to pre-Islamic traditions and the new bud symbolises the renewal of life.</p><h3 class="copy--h3">Nowruz sport: kok-boru</h3><p>For locals and tourists alike, Nowruz is also often an excuse to get out and watch&nbsp;<em>kok-boru</em>. Known originally as <em>buzkashi</em>&nbsp;(a Persian phrase meaning 'goat dragging'), the name of the game varies from country to country but the chief objective is the same: a team of horsemen carry a goat carcass to a large goal at the end of a playing field&nbsp;while preventing a competing team from doing the same. Though&nbsp;deeply traditional, some visitors understandably&nbsp;may find the sport unsettling or even gruesome.</p><p class="stack__article__image-container"><a href="/travel-blog/tip-article/wordpress_uploads/2016/03/IMG_5024.jpg" class="copy--body__link"></a><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/travel-tips-and-articles/celebrating-nowruz-the-central-asian-way&amp;media=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/travel-blog/tip-article/wordpress_uploads/2016/03/IMG_5024.jpg&amp;description=Kok-boru%20and%20other%20equestrian%20sports%20are%20popular%20throughout%20the%20" stans="" class="social__item social__item--pinterest social__item--pinned" target="blank">  <span class="accessibility">Pin this image</span>  <span class="social__icon icon--pinterest icon--white"></span></a><img class="wp-image-100901 size-full stack__article__image is-landscape" src="//images-resrc.staticlp.com/S=W748/O=75/http://www.lonelyplanet.com/travel-blog/tip-article/wordpress_uploads/2016/03/IMG_5024.jpg" alt="Kok-boru and other equestrian sports are popular throughout the 'Stans during Nowruz © Stephen Lioy / Lonely Planet"> <span class="copy--caption img--caption"><em>Kok-boru</em> and other equestrian sports are popular throughout the 'Stans during Nowruz © Stephen Lioy / Lonely Planet</span></p><p>The rules of the game&nbsp;sound simple, but the crashing of twenty fierce riders who are&nbsp;attempting&nbsp;the already significant challenge of dragging a whole goat from ground to horseback to goal is&nbsp;an event meriting the furore&nbsp;of the large crowds that gather to watch.
