The city is less crowded than in the summer months but the cultural offerings still abound for locals and visitors alike. The month begins with the second annual Treme Fall Fest (<a href="http://faubourgtreme.wix.com/tremefest" target="_blank" class="copy--body__link">tremefest.com</a>), a celebration of this historic community, the nation’s oldest African American neighborhood.

The end of October is a particularly fun time to visit New Orleans, when the Halloween vibe really amps up the gothic charm of the city. The premier event is the LGBT community’s Halloween New Orleans (<a href="http://www.halloweenneworleans.com/" target="_blank" class="copy--body__link">halloweenneworleans.com</a>), a four day extravaganza that benefits Project Lazarus, a nonprofit residential home for men and women with AIDs in the city. All proceeds from the festival go to funding the work that Project Lazarus does throughout the year. The event includes club nights, a costumed parade (this year’s theme is pirates!), and a second line parade and jazz brunch.</p><p>The Voodoo Music and Arts Experience (<a href="http://www.voodoofestival.com/" target="_blank" class="copy--body__link">voodoofestival.com</a>) is the last big music event of the year, and probably the most comfortable one to attend, weather-wise. This year’s headliners include Tool, Arcade Fire, Band of Horses and Foals, all taking place in City Park. Food from some of New Orleans’ best chefs and large scale art installations are dotted around the park for the duration of the festival.</p><p><em>Rebecca Warren is Destination Editor for Eastern USA.
